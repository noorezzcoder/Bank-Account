# Bank-Account
This project is example to Encapsulation object oriented programming (OOP)

 This project is a simple implementation of a Bank Account system in Java, designed to demonstrate the concept of Encapsulation in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

The BankAccount class securely encapsulates account data such as the balance and transaction history. Access to this data is controlled using private fields and public methods, ensuring that sensitive information cannot be accessed or modified directly from outside the class.

The project also includes functionality such as:

Depositing and withdrawing money

Viewing the current balance

Recording a simple transaction history using a string variable

This example highlights how encapsulation helps in building robust, secure, and maintainable code by keeping internal details hidden and exposing only necessary functionality.
